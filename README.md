📘 Web Development Learning Journey – Day-wise Progress

Welcome to my web development learning repository! 🌐✨
This repository documents my self-paced journey into the world of full stack web development 💻🔧.

🗂️ The code and projects are organized in a day-by-day sequence (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, ...), making it easy to follow my progress step by step. Each day reflects hands-on practice, exploration of new concepts, and real coding exercises.

🚀 This journey showcases my dedication to consistent growth, covering both front-end 🎨 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and back-end ⚙️ (APIs, databases, servers) technologies.

🔍 Whether you're a recruiter, mentor, or fellow developer, feel free to explore the folders to see how my skills have evolved over time. This repository serves as both a learning archive and a personal portfolio of my development journey.

🙌 Thanks for stopping by!
